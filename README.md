# V2G Liberty: optimised vehicle-to-grid charging of your EV

This integration lets you add full automatic and price optimized control over Vehicle to grid (V2G) charging. It has a 
practical local app in [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and uses the smart EMS [FlexMeasures](https://flexmeasures.io) for optimized schedules.

The schedules are optimized on EPEX day-ahead energy prices, so this works best with an electricity contract with dynamic (hourly) prices[^1].
We intend to add optimisation for your solar generation or the CO₂ content of the grid in the near future.

[^1]: For now: only Dutch energy prices, if you have interest in this software and live outside the Netherlands, please [contact us](https://v2g-liberty.eu/) to see what the options are.

![The V2G Liberty Dashboard](https://positive-design.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/V2GL-1-1024x549.png)

You can read more about the project and its vision [here](https://v2g-liberty.eu/) and [here](https://seita.nl/project/v2ghome-living-lab/).

In practice, V2G Liberty does the following:
- In automatic mode: No worries, just plugin when you return home and let the system automatically optimize charging. 
- Set targets (e.g. be charged 100% at 7am tomorrow) which prompts FlexMeasures to update its schedules.
- Override the system and set charging to "Max Boost Now" mode in cases where you need as much battery SoC a possible quickly.

This integration is a Python app and uses:

- FlexMeasures for optimizing charging schedules. FlexMeasures is periodically asked to generate optimized charging schedules.
- Home Assistant for automating local control over your Wallbox Quasar. V2G Liberty translates this into set points which it sends to the Wallbox Quasar via modbus.
- The AppDaemon plugin for Home Assistant for running the Python app.

### Prerequisites
 
At the time of writing, 2022-11, only the [Wallbox Quasar 1 charger](https://wallbox.com/en_uk/quasar-dc-charger) is supported.
This is a [CHAdeMO](https://www.chademo.com/) compatible charger.
Compatible cars that can do V2G with this protocol are the [Nissan Leaf](https://ev-database.org/car/1657/Nissan-Leaf-eplus) (also earlier models) and [Nissan Evalia](https://ev-database.org/car/1117/Nissan-e-NV200-Evalia).
When the Quasar 2 will be available in the EU we expect V2G Liberty to be compatible with this hardware right away.
Then also CCS V2G capable cars can be managed with V2G Liberty.
Hopefully other chargers will follow soon.

## Preparation

Before installing or activation of V2G Liberty, please make sure that charging and discharging with the car and charger works properly.
Test this with the app supplied with the charger.
This is important because V2G Liberty will 'take control' over the charger.
Operating the charger either through the screen of the charger or the app will not work (reliably) anymore when V2G Liberty is active.

### FlexMeasures

The cloud backend [FlexMeasures](https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures) provides the smart schedules needed for optimizing the charging and discharging.
You can run your own instance of FlexMeasures, but you can also make use of an instance run by Seita.
If you prefer this option, please [contact us](https://v2g-liberty.eu).

### Home assistant

As said, Home Assistant (from now on we’ll abbreviate this to HA) forms the basis of V2G Liberty.
So before you can start with V2G Liberty you'll need a running HA in your network. Both HA and the charger need to be on the same network and must be able to communicate.
HA typically runs on a small computer, e.g. a Raspberry PI, but it can also run on a NAS or an old laptop.
HA has some [suggestions for hardware](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2022/04/16/device-to-run-home-assistant/).
For the installation of HA on your (edge) computer, [guides](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) can be found online and help can be sought in many active forums.

### An electricity contract with dynamic prices

As said, the software optimizes for EPEX day-ahead prices, so a contract of this type is the best option.
There is no rush, though.
You can try out V2G Liberty first and later on get the dynamic contract.
In the Netherlands there are several suppliers, o.a. ANWB, Energy Zero, Tibber, Zonneplan, etc.
This changes the way your electricity is priced and billed, so it is wise to find information and make sure you really understand what this means for your situation before making this change.

### Get a GitHub account

You’ll need a GitHub account for getting the V2G Liberty source code and for setting up HACS (see later).
So go ahead and [get a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) (it is free) if you do not have this yet.

### Get an online calendar

For the situations where you would like the car to be fully charged, e.g. for a longer trip, V2G Liberty optimizes on a dedicated digital (online) calendar.
An online/digital calendar is mandatory, without it V2G Liberty cannot work.

It is of course most useful if the calendar is integrated with your normal calendar and if you can easily edit the calendar items on your smartphone (outside HA / V2G Liberty).
You make the appointments on your phone or laptop directly, not through HA.
Home Assistant only reads the appointments from the online calendar.
Options are, for example:
- A CalDav compatible calendar. E.g. NextCloud or OwnCloud if you’d like an open-source solution
- iCloud, this can be reached through CalDav (or through the HA integration – no examples yet)
- Google calendar. This works fine with the Google Calendar integration in Home Assistant (not to be confused with Google Assistant)
- Office 365. Via non-official O365-HomeAssistant integration, see GitHub
- ICS Calendar (or iCalendar) integration, also non-official. It can be found on HACS.

We recommend a separate calendar for the car reservations.
Filtering only the car reservations is also an option.
The result must be that in Home Assistant only the events meant for the car are present.
Preferably name the calendar (`car_reservation`). If you name(d) it otherwise, update the calendar name in the 
configuration of V2G Liberty secrets.yaml.

## Installation

Now that you have a running Home Assistant, you're ready to install V2G Liberty in Home Assistant.
We'll take you through the process step by step.

### Install HACS

The Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) has loads of integrations that are not in the official store of HA.
You'll need two of these and that's why you also need to install this add-on.
It is explained on the [HACS installation pages](https://hacs.xyz).
As a reference you might find this [instruction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6ZlhE-Iv9E) a handy resource.

### Add modules to HA via HACS

Add the following modules to HA through HACS:
- [ApexChart-card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card)<br>
  This is needed for graphs in the user interface.
- [Custom-card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)<br>
  This is needed for a better UI.

There are other modules that might look interesting, like Leaf Spy, but you do not need any of these for V2G-L.
After installation the reference to these resources has to be added through menu:
1. Make sure, advanced mode is enabled in your user profile (click on your user name to get there)
2. Navigate to Settings -> Dashboards -> from the top right menu (&vellip;) select resources.
3. Click (+ ADD RESOURCE) button and enter URL `/hacsfiles/apexcharts-card/apexcharts-card.js` and select type "JavaScript Module".
4. Repeat for `/hacsfiles/lovelace-card-mod/card-mod.js`
4. Restart Home Assistant.


## Configure HA

This is not complicated, but you'll need to work precise. The configuration of HA is stored in .yaml files, these can be edited in the HA file editor (in the left main menu).

  > If you have installed V2G Liberty before, please remove any changes made during that installation to the .yaml files.

After completion of this step you'll end up with a these files and folders (others might be there but are not shown here). Some might be already present and only need editing. Others files or folders might need to added. The files you'll have to edit are marked with *.

```

```

### Secrets

HA stores secrets in the file `secrets.yaml` and V2G Liberty expects this file to be in the default location, the config folder.
We store both secrets and configuration values in this file as this is the most conveniant way for storing these.
Open this file in the HA file editor and add the following code. You'll need to replace secrets/values for your custom setting.
If you have installed the Studio Code Server addon (not mandatory!), you can use that.

# The maximum usable energy storage capacity of the battery of the car, as an integer.
# For the Nissan Leaf this is usually 21, 36 or 56 kWh 
car_max_capacity_in_kwh: 56

# What would you like to be the minimum charge in your battery?
# The scheduling will not discharge below this value and if the car returns with
# and SoC below this value, the battery will be charged to this minimum asap
# before regular scheduling.
# A high value results in always having a greater driving range available, even

# A lower value reults in sometimes a smaller driving range available for
# un-planned drives but there is always more capacity for discharge and so more
# earnings.
# Some research suggests battery life is shorter if min SoC is below 15%.
# In some cars the SoC every now and then skips a number, eg. from 21 to 19%, 
# skipping 20%. This might result in toggling charging behaviour around this

# reduce battery health/life time. 
# When a calendar item is present, the schedule will ignore this setting and
# try to charge to 100% (or if the calendar item has a target use that).

```

### Copy & edit files

In your Home Assistant file editor, go to `/config/appdaemon/apps/` and create a new folder `v2g-liberty`.
Within the v2g-liberty folder create a new folder `app-config`.
From this GitHub project copy all files to the respective folders.

## Install the AppDaemon 4 add-on

AppDaemon is an official add-on for HA and thus can be installed from within HA.
Please go to Settings -> Add-ons -> Add-on store and find the AppDaemon add-on.
When installed AppDaemon needs to be configured, look for (`Supervisor -> AppDaemon 4 -> Configuration`) and add the following Python packages:

```yaml
python_packages:
  - isodate
  - pyModbusTCP
```
### AppDaemon configuration

To configure AppDaemon you'll need to add the following to the appdaemon.yaml file.

```yaml
---
secrets: /config/secrets.yaml

appdaemon:
  latitude: !secret ha_latitude
  longitude: !secret ha_longitude
  elevation: !secret ha_elevation

## Configure HA to use v2g-liberty

This (nearly last) step will combine the work you've done so far: it adds V2G Liberty to HA.
In your Home Assistant file editor, go to `/config/configuration.yaml` and add the following to the top of the file:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages:
    v2g_pack: !include appdaemon/apps/v2g-liberty/app_config/v2g_liberty_package.yaml
```

### Convenient HA optimisations

These are "out of the box" super handy HA features that are highly recommended.

#### Add users

This is optional but is highly recommended.
This lets all persons in the household operate the charger.

#### Install the HA app on your mobile

This is optional but highly recommended.
You can get it from the official app store of your phone platform.
If you’ve logged in, the mobile can later be used to receive notifications.

#### Make V2G Liberty your default dashboard

After the restart (next step) you'll find the V2G Liberty dashboard in the sidebar. 
Probably underneath "Overview", which then likely is the current default dashboard. To make the V2G Liberty dashboard 
your default go to `Settings > Dashboards`. Select the V2G Liberty dashboard row and click th link "SET AS DEFAULT IN THIS DEVICE".



## Start it up
Now that so many files have changed/been added a restart of both Home Assistant and AppDaemon is needed.
HA can be restarted by `Settings > System > Restart (top right)`.
AppDaemon can be (re-)started via `Settings > Add-ons > AppDaemon > (Re-)start`.

Now the system needs 5 to 10 minutes before it runs nicely. If a car is connected you should see a schedule comming in soon after.
